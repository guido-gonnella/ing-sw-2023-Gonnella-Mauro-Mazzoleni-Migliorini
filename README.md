## Implemented Functions

- Complete Rules
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Socket Communication

## Compiling

The JARs have been created with the help of Maven Shade Plugin.
Below are the precompiled JARs.
To compile the JARs independently, navigate to the folder \MyShelfie in the project directory and run the following command
```
mvn clean package
```
The compiled JARs will be placed in the folder ```target/``` with the names
```ServerApp.jar``` e ```ClientApp.jar```.

### Jar

Precompiled Jars can be found at the following link: [Jar](https://github.com/guido-gonnella/ing-sw-2023-Gonnella-Mauro-Mazzoleni-Migliorini/tree/main/Deliverables/final/jar)

## Execution 

### Server

To launch the server enter the following command
```
java -jar ServerApp.jar
```

### Client

To launch the server enter the following command
```
java -jar ClientApp.jar
```
It is possible to add the parameter ``` -g ``` or ``` --gui ``` to use the GUI, otherwise
the game will be played on the CLI.
